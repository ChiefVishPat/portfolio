## About

I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable backend systems and AI-powered workflows for real-world finance and operations use cases. Recently, I’ve:

- Contracted at **Ramp**, shipping backend receipt integrations used by major merchants like United Airlines, Delta Airlines, and Walmart.
- Built AI-driven agents that automate inboxes, document workflows, and data extraction.

I enjoy working close to the product: understanding real customer pain points, then building systems that are observable, resilient, and easy to iterate on.

## Experience

### Stealth AI FinTech Startup – Credit Risk & Fraud Automation  
**Software Engineer (Contract)** · August 2025 – November 2025  
Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), LangChain/LangGraph, PydanticAI  

- Architected an AI-driven email agent that triaged high-volume AP/AR inboxes in real time, eliminating manual sorting and reducing missed vendor/customer inquiries.
- Automated intent detection and response drafting for common finance workflows (payment status, invoice copies, disputes), reducing analyst workload by an estimated 60–70%.
- Designed an extensible orchestration layer (LangGraph + PydanticAI) that scaled across multiple tenants and channels (email, WhatsApp, Slack), supporting enterprise-grade throughput.
